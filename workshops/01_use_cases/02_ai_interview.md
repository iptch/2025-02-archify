# Interview on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI Scalability

## Purpose

The goal of this interview is to gather insights and practical knowledge from a colleague who has worked extensively with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI-based systems. This information will help guide our software architecture decisions.

## Interview Structure

The interview will include a mix of high-level and technical questions. Topics range from AI provider selection (AWS, Google, Azure, OpenAI, etc.) to more detailed questions about performance tuning, data integration, security, and lessons learned from real-world projects.

Below are the questions we plan to ask:

---

### 1. **Platform & Provider Selection**
> Which AI platform providers (e.g., AWS, Google, Azure, or others) have you used for RAG-based solutions, and why did you choose them?

### 2. **Core Components of RAG**
> Could you walk me through the main components of a RAG architecture and how they fit together (retriever, reader, knowledge source, etc.)?

### 3. **Data Source Integration**
> What types of data sources have you integrated into your RAG pipeline (databases, APIs, documents, etc.), and how challenging was it to bring them all together?

### 4. **Scaling Approaches**
> When going from a few hundred users to thousands, what are the most significant technical considerations for scaling a RAG system?

### 5. **Performance Tuning**
> Have you encountered latency or throughput issues in your RAG solutions, and what strategies did you use to improve performance?

### 6. **Security & Access Control**
> How do you handle sensitive or proprietary information when using RAG? What security measures have you found most effective?

### 7. **Trade-offs in Model Selection**
> What are your thoughts on using large pre-trained models vs. smaller, more specialized models for RAG? When do you decide one is more appropriate than the other?

### 8. **Human-in-the-Loop**
> What’s your approach to balancing AI-driven automation with human oversight, especially in processes that used to require manual intervention (like exam corrections)?

### 9. **Tooling & Frameworks**
> Which libraries or frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face, Haystack, LangChain) have been most helpful for building RAG pipelines?

### 10. **Quality Metrics & Measurement**
> How do you measure success for your RAG solution? Are there specific metrics or KPIs you focus on (accuracy, F1, user satisfaction, etc.)?

### 11. **Content Filtering & Moderation**
> What strategies do you use to ensure the AI doesn’t generate incorrect, inappropriate, or biased outputs?

### 12. **Cost Management**
> Speaking of cost, how do you predict and manage the cost of inference and data storage, especially if user traffic grows significantly?

### 13. **Retrieval Engine Selection**
> What influenced your choice of retrieval engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Pinecone, or vector databases like Milvus)? Any particular pros and cons?

### 14. **Data Preprocessing & Curation**
> How important is data preprocessing and curation in improving RAG outputs, and what best practices would you recommend?

### 15. **Versioning & Updating Knowledge Sources**
> How do you handle updates to your knowledge base over time to ensure the RAG model stays current?

### 16. **Iterative Experimentation**
> What kind of experimentation process do you follow when iterating on the RAG pipeline (A/B testing, user feedback loops, etc.)?

### 17. **Lessons & Pitfalls**
> What are the biggest pitfalls you’ve encountered while deploying RAG at scale, and how would you advise others to avoid them?
