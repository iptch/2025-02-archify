# Define Structured Output and Guardrails

## Date:
2025-02-15

## Status:
Proposed

## Decision Details
We will implement a standardized JSON output format with validation guardrails for AI-generated grading results.

## Context:
Our automated grading system requires structured output to ensure seamless processing by downstream systems. Guardrails will be implemented to enforce output validity and mitigate errors.

## Decision:
#### JSON Output Requirements
AI generated grading results must follow a predefined schema, containing the fields `grade`, `feedback`, `remarks`. This JSON schema is extended in the next step via the prompt orchestrator with metadata such as `exam_id`, `candidate_id` and `timestamp`.
#### Guardrails
- Schema enforcement: AI generated output will be validated against a schema to ensure correct data types, required fields, and JSON format "constraints".
- Post-Processing Validation: Before submission to downstream systems, results will be checked for missing or malformed fields. --> **Invalid output triggers a retry mechanism.**
- Fallback Handling: If validation fails after three retries, the system will escalate for manual review.

### Why did we take this decision?
Consistent JSON output with schema validation reduces parsing complexity, minimizes errors, and guards against malformed responses while ensuring reliable downstream handling with minimal manual intervention.

## Consequences:
- Implementation Overhead: We must develop or configure components that validate or constrain model output to guarantee valid JSON. This includes prompt design, schema validation libraries and other post-processing steps.
- Error Handling: If the AI generates invalid or partial JSON, we make use of a fallback or retry mechanism to correct or flag issues for further review.
- Greater Predictability: Once implemented, the consistent format facilitates efficient data flow, reduces integration costs, and improves the overall reliability of the grading system.
