# Define Structured Output and Guardrails

## Date:
2025-02-15

## Status:
Proposed

## Decision Details
We will implement a standardized JSON output format with validation guardrails for all AI-generated grading results.

## Context:
Our automated grading system, powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), needs to supply results that can be seamlessly processed by downstream systems. We require a structured output and possibly some output guardrails to ensure that the downstream system can handle the output of our AI model.

## Decision:
* JSON output: Implement a well-defined JSON schema (e.g., containing fields like grade, feedback, remarks, and any other required metadata).
* Add guardrails to ensure that the system consistently delivers valid JSON in the specified format (through schema validation, generation constraints, or post-processing checks).

### Why did we take this decision?
* Smooth Integration: Consistent JSON output reduces the complexity of parsing and downstream handling, minimizing errors and manual intervention.
* Reliability: By enforcing structure and validating against a schema, we guard against malformed or incomplete responses.

## Consequences:
* Implementation Overhead: We must develop or configure components that validate or constrain model output to guarantee valid JSON. This could include prompt design, schema validation libraries, or post-processing steps.
* Error Handling: If the AI generates invalid or partial JSON, we need a fallback or retry mechanism to correct or flag issues for further review.
* Greater Predictability: Once implemented, the consistent format facilitates efficient data flow, reduces integration costs, and improves the overall reliability of the grading system.
